To build and run the Synonyms Service sample, first go to https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/synonyms and register there for an API key. During the Customer Technical Preview phase, it is free to use this service.
Then, edit file SysnonymsServiceTask.cs. Comment out the #error line, and paste in your API key as the value of the static string BING_KEY.
